# Impact Client

Impact is an advanced Minecraft Hacked Client aimed towards user friendliness.
Here, you will be able to submit issues that prevent the client from performing as expected.
In the future, there may be a chance of the Client being Open-Source'd as well as it being based off of the [ClientAPI](https://github.com/ZeroMemes/ClientAPI)

## Impact 3.0 Update
With the Minecraft 1.11 update, there were multiple changes to game mechanics, making Impact 3.0 experience some bugs.

One of the major changes was to the inventory. Slots that are not filled with items are now counted as air items.
This means that any checks in mods to see if a slot does not contain an item has been broken.

Another issue that users have been experiencing is the lack of functionality to AutoFish, I have not discovered the
route cause to this yet, It is expected that this will be fixed in the 4.0 update.
